DevOps Learning Journey

 My hands-on path to learning DevOps engineering. Starting from Linux basics, building up to automation, 
 scripting, and eventually cloud infrastructure.

 What I've Built So Far
 
- Linux Basics ✓

      File Organizer -  Sorts files into directories by type
      Backup Archiver - Creates compressed backups with timestamps
      Practiced permissions, navigation, and file management on a mock company directory structure

- Bash Scripting ✓

   Automation Scripts:

      Automated Backup System - Scheduled backups with .tar.gz compression
      System Info Reporter - Displays CPU, memory, disk usage
      Calculator - Command-line calculator using functions
      Todo List Manager - Add, view, delete tasks from terminal
      File Counter - Count lines, words, bytes in files
      Process Monitor & Starter - Check and restart processes

- What I learned: Variables, loops, conditionals, functions, error handling, text processing
 
  Python Scripting (In Progress)
 
       Learning Python for more complex automation tasks that go beyond what Bash can handle efficiently.
Focus areas:

    - API interactions and data processing
    - Cross-platform automation scripts
    - Cloud service automation
    - Building tools that need better error handling and maintainability

  What's Next
  Python Track:

    Variables, data types, functions 
    Working with APIs 
    Rebuilding some Bash scripts in Python to see the differences

- Future Topics:

    - Docker
    - CI/CD pipelines
    - AWS/Cloud automation
    - Kubernetes
    - Infrastructure as Code
 
 Why This Repo Exists
 
       Building practical automation skills for DevOps engineering. Each section focuses on tools and scripts 
       that solve real problems - from backing up systems to monitoring resources to automating repetitive tasks.
       The goal is to have a collection of working scripts and a clear progression from basic Linux commands to full 
       infrastructure automation.



       This started as a Bash scripting repo, now expanding into a full DevOps learning journey.
