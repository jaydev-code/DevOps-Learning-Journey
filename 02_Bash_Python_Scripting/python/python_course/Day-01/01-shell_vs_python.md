Understanding what is shell and python

Shell Scripting And Python Scripting

- whats difference ?
- what both best for?

 
Shell:
 
 A shell is a terminal interface used to interact with a computer, whether Linux, Windows, 
 or other operating systems. There are many types of shells, but the most common is Bash. Bash 
 scripting is a sequence of shell commands written in a file, which is called shell scripting.

Shell Scripting Uses:
 
 Shell scripts are used for managing directories, automating OS tasks, and managing processes.
 They are lightweight, fast, and ideal for system-level automation, including CI/CD pipelines and server tasks.

Python Scripting:

 Python scripting uses the Python programming language. It is more robust than shell scripting, 
 cross-platform, and has a rich set of modules and libraries. Python can run on Linux, Windows, macOS, and more.

Python Scripting Uses:
 
 Python is best for complex tasks, such as interacting with APIs, processing data, and handling 
 pipelines that require logic and error management. It is ideal for DevOps workflows that involve 
 cloud services, automation, and multi-step processes.

Summary:

 Shell scripting → Best for OS-level automation, directory management, and process control.

 Python scripting → Best for complex automation, API integration, and pipelines requiring logic or error handling.

In DevOps, engineers often use both together: Shell for system orchestration, Python for complex automation and cloud workflows.
