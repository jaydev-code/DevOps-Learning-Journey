# Bash Scripting Practice & Mini-Projects

This repository contains my practice scripts and mini-projects as I learn **Linux** and **Bash scripting** (Oct 2025 onwards).  

## Structure
- `practices/` → Small practice scripts for loops, arrays, conditionals, etc.  
- `mini-projects/` → Larger scripts that solve real problems (e.g., backup automation, organizers).  

## Goals
- Build strong Linux command-line skills  
- Automate daily tasks with Bash  
- Prepare for DevOps career path  

## How to run
Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaydev-code/BashScripting.git
