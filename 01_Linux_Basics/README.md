# 🐧 Linux Basics

This section contains my early Linux command-line practices.
- **file_management/** → move, copy, delete, and organize files  
- **permissions/** → learning `chmod`, `chown`, and access levels  
- **navigation/** → using `cd`, `pwd`, `ls`, and relative paths  

These exercises helped me understand Linux fundamentals before diving into Bash scripting and automation.
